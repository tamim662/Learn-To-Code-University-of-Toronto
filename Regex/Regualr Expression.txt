Design a single program with all the following regular expressions using any programming language
of your choice. Choose the language appropriately. You are not allowed to change the language in
your future assignments. Copying code is strictly prohibited. Fully or partially copied code from
Internet or Friend = 0 Mark. However, if you do the code by your own and completed partially you
will get a decent partial mark.
